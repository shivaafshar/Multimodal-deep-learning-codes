# Multimodal-deep-learning-codes
This files containes the codes that are used to generate the proximity and co-expression features and designing multimodal deep learning model to predeict the cell-type-specific FGNs in "A multimodal deep learning model to infer cell-type-specific functional gene networks" paper.

"proximity.py" file contains the codes to generate proximity features.
"co-expression-multimodal-model.py" contains the codes to generate co-expression features and gene pairs prediction scores.
"multimodal-deep-learning-keras.py" contains the codes to design the multimodal deep learning model.
